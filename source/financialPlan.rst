Source and Use of Funds
=======================

Total start-up costs are estimated to be $363,000.  The majority of the costs are associated with the restaurant equipment, inventory and furniture and furnishings for the dining room.  Total costs for these items are reported to be $110,500.  The costs are associated with build out and renovation of the restaurant to provide updated plumbing and creating additional space in the dining area by removing a non-supporting wall:  $50,000.  Additional start up expenses are in the form of working capital and contingency $182,500.

Jeff and Betty Wright will contribute $174, 000 and are requesting an additional $189,000 in the form of a bank loan. The loan is expected to be a fully amortizing 5 year term note secured by UCC filings on all furniture fixtures and equipment.

Break-Even Analysis
====================

Total fixed costs associated with the restaurant are $669,186 and represent the annual expenses. The variable cost (overhead) is estimated to be $4.51 per meal.  Based on the assumption of $11.37 as the average meal price, the breakeven revenue then is $1,108,970 or 97,535 meals (units). This is further depicted in the Table Below and the Graph that follow:
