Daily Operations and Production
===============================

THR will be open 7 days a week for lunch and dinner requiring multiple shifts. Jeff will write the schedules.  The schedules will be written in a manner that will allow the ability to increase or decrease hourly labor according to sales volume in order to maintain a consistent labor cost control.

Proper labeling and rotation techniques, accompanied by ample storage facilities will ensure that high quality prepared product will be sufficiently available to meet the demands during peak business hours. Replenishment and ongoing preparation will continue during off peak business hours.

Jeff Wright will be responsible for ordering, receiving and maintaining sufficient inventory to meet production demands. Ordering schedules will be staggered with perishable products being ordered multiple times per week to preserve freshness. Standard grocery and supply orders will be ordered less often, according to a predetermined schedule and storage capacity. 

Mr. Wright will rely on operational checklists to verify that each work shift has been properly prepared for and to insure the operational standards are followed before, during and after work shifts. 

The restaurant layout, including the dining room, kitchen and serving line, has been designed for efficiency and flexibility to accommodate the fluctuation in customer traffic and peak meal periods. 

Upon arrival, guests will be greeted immediately by either the assistant manager or a server and asked for the seating preference.  Drink orders will be taken and guests can munch on our complimentary rolls.  Once the customer’s order is taken, the order will automatically be printed to a requisition printer located in the grill area. The grill cook will use the printed ticket to keep track of orders and place the meal under the heating lamps until the order is complete. The kitchen preparation line has been designed to be operated by a minimum staff of 1 line cook and a maximum of 4 cooks. This design allows line staffing to be adjusted to the business volume.  Shift changes for all staff will involve cleanup, restocking and preparation. All monies will be settled at the end of each shift. The closing shift will involve designated closing duties that will leave the restaurant clean and fully prepared for the next day. 

Competitive Comparison
===============================

The US restaurant industry includes about 480,000 restaurants with combined annual revenue of about $400 billion. Major companies include Brinker International which owns Chili’s Grill & Bar) and Maggiano’s, Ruby Tuesdays McDonald's; YUM! Brands (KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell); and Darden Restaurants (Olive Garden, Red Lobster). The industry is highly fragmented: the 50 largest companies hold just 20 percent of the market.

Local competitors within a five mile radius are as follows. 

   * Hedarys Restaurant 
             This is a full service family restaurant established in 1977.  The 5,000 SF restaurant run as a sole proprietorship, has 17 employees and generates $1.7 million in revenue annually.  Prices are higher than THR and range from $8.00-$20 per entrée. 
   * Applebee’s
             This is a chain restaurant offering standard fare. The food quality is average.  Entrées range from $6.99 - $20. 
   * Chili’s 
             This is a chain restaurant also offering standard fare.  Food choices are varied and prices range for $8-$21. 
   * Barbeque Ben’s
             This is sole proprietorship offering primarily barbeque item. Although the food offering does not compete directly with the subject, the restaurant targets the same neighborhood families and has been operating at the single location since 1978.  Entrée range from $8.99-$12.
   * Cracker Barrel 
             Located along Interstate 30, the restaurant is not located within the target market area.  However due to its menu offering of home comfort food, the restaurant attracts a similar market, although Cracker Barrel’s attract the tourist business as well.  Entrées range in price from $7.99-$14.

Suppliers
=========
Because of their years of experience combined with their existing catering business, Jeff and Betty Wright have established relationships with qualified suppliers.  These suppliers can provide reasonably priced products, delivered according to the schedule.  

Management Controls 
===================

The Wrights will practice sound management procedures in order to control costs, insure quality of product and provide friendly customer service. The following systems will be used by management:

   Order Guide: The restaurant will use an item specific order guide to track order history and maintain designated levels of product in inventory.

   Weekly Inventory: Management will conduct a weekly inventory to determine valuation for use in the preparation of weekly profit and loss reports.

   Daily Inventory Tracking: Daily inventory will be taken on specific items. Movement will be compared to sales data to ensure designated products have been properly accounted for.

Administrative Systems 
======================

With a limited staff, it is crucial that the Wrights remain current with daily cash outlay.  The purchase of a POS system will immensely help them with these daily administrative reports:
 
   Daily Cash Control  
     Sales and receipts recorded by the POS system will be compared to actual cash and credit card deposits on a daily basis. Acceptable over/short amounts will be limited to $5.00 per day. Discrepancies greater than $5.00 will prompt management to conduct an immediate audit to account for the difference. Monthly totals will be compared to actual P&L statements for accuracy. Cash, debit card and credit card receipts will be deposited in a deposit.

   Weekly Prime Cost Report
     Jeff Wright will prepare a weekly report that shows the gross profit margin after cost of goods sold and labor cost has been deducted from the sales revenue. The prime cost for this type of restaurant is expected to range from 60% to 65%. Proper control of the prime cost is the single most effective measure of management’s ability to operate the restaurant.

   Purchasing Records/Payables
     A part time bookkeeper will process and record invoices and credits daily. Reports detailing cash expenditures, payments by check, and accounts payable transactions will be readily available. Check disbursements will be prepared by the bookkeeper. Check signing authority for the general operating account will be given to the general manager.

   Payroll Processing
     Payroll checks will be issued bi-monthly. Jeff Wright will run reports from the time & attendance system, make necessary adjustments, and prepare for transfer to the payroll system. Payroll will be processed by a payroll processing service.

Future Services
===============
THR has future plans to provide catering services for family reunions, weddings and other events desiring a “home-style” menu.  This could potentially become a large portion of gross sales. The Wrights are targeting Year 2 and at that point, a sales agent would be hired to directly market the products for daily delivery or catered functions.
