Industry Analysis
=================

This analysis is based on the Standard Industry Code (“SIC”) 5812:  Eating and Drinking Places Establishments primarily engaged in the retail sale of prepared food and drinks for on-premise or immediate consumption.  It is also based on the North American Industry Classification System (“NAICS”) 722110 - Full-Service Restaurants. 

This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in providing food services to patrons who order and are served while seated (i.e., waiter/waitress services) and pay after eating.  These establishments may provide food services to patrons in combination with selling alcoholic beverages, providing carry out services, or presenting live nontheatrical entertainment.

Demographics, consumer tastes, and personal income drive demand.  The profitability of individual companies can vary: while QSRs rely on efficient operations and high volume sales, FSRs rely on high-margin items and effective marketing.  Large companies have advantages in purchasing, finance, and marketing.  Small companies can offer superior food or service.  The industry is labor-intensive. (First Research)

Wages form a significant proportion of operating costs.  The existence of a statutory minimum wage in most states increases the need for players to keep other costs as lean as possible, which in turn increases the importance of suppliers.  A slight complication is that in some states, foodservice employers are able to treat tips received by their staff as contributing to their wages; in such states, this policy reduces the impact of the minimum wage from the employers' perspective. (Data Monitor)  

Annual revenue per worker is less than $50,000. 


Restaurants compete with companies that serve meals or prepared foods, including grocery stores, warehouse clubs, delis, and convenience stores. In addition, restaurants compete with home cooking.

Among FSRs, most establishments focus on Italian cuisine, steak, or seafood.  Hamburger joints make up a majority of QSR locations, along with pizza parlors and sub sandwich shops. Industry revenue is roughly evenly split between FSRs QSRs.

In FSRs, waiters take orders, serve beverages and meals, present the check, and process payment.  FSRs include casual dining (full bar); family dining (limited bar); and fine dining establishments.

Annual sales average $860,000 for FSRs.


An FSR's square footage and the number of seats and tables dictate how many patrons it can serve (also known as table turns or covers) directly affects sales. Because the restaurant industry is highly competitive, site selection is critical: companies may consider population density, household income, competition, visibility, accessibility, and traffic.

Companies carefully manage inventory of perishable food products, such as fresh seafood and dairy goods, to reduce losses due to spoilage.  

Computerized information systems can improve and link food preparation and serving operations.  Touch screen ordering programs ensure accurate communication of customer orders. Timing systems monitor meal progress and can alert staff if an order is running behind schedule.  Reservations programs maximize traffic flow and seating.  Inventory management systems track supply levels and can help reduce waste due to spoilage. Cost accounting programs help companies determine the profitability of individual menu items.  Handheld point-of-sale (POS) devices allow servers to place orders and print checks tableside, improving accuracy and reducing ordering time.  Some handhelds can also print customer checks and process credit card payments. (First Research)
